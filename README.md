# mindNets

This module is an exploration on wearable and wireless brain-computer interfaces and their potential for artistic experimentation and deeper inquiry on the possibility of expanding and sharing brain data by technological means. The students will get hands on some of these EEGs and will learn how to connect to them and extract their data while considering important questions regarding the meaning of such data. Eventually we will program simple Android Applications to interact with the brain-sensor and other features from the phone, including the camera. The main objective is to think about the possibility of a technologically-augmented and networked mind, while prototyping systems that resolve in artistic expressions.
