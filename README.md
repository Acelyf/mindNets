This module is an exploration on wearable and wireless brain-computer interfaces and their potential for artistic experimentation and deeper inquiry on the possibility of expanding and sharing brain data by technological means. The students will get hands on some of these EEGs and will learn how to connect to them and extract their data while considering important questions regarding the meaning of such data. Eventually we will program simple Android Applications to interact with the brain-sensor and other features from the phone, including the camera. The main objective is to think about the possibility of a technologically-augmented and networked mind, while prototyping systems that resolve in artistic expressions.

### Session 1

**Description:** Introduction to the the idea of augmented networked minds; this session will begin with a one and a half hour long presentation and short discussion about some theories and concepts behind the main focus of the module. Some related projects will be presented, from both artistic and non-artistic fields. Finished the presentation, the class will continue with a demonstration of a portable electroencephalogram and how it can be wireless interfaced with a computer. We will use processing to write a simple android application which can read and extract the data from the EEG.

**Homework::MEMORY** (due next session): In groups, the students will think about the 	relevance of human memory and how technology can mediate and/or augment this. With the acquired skills from session one the groups should prototype their idea into a simple 	wearable brain-computer interface with a phone APP, which in its functionality, generates an artistic discourse. IMPORTANT: to document in video and post on the class's blog the results of 	the exercise.
